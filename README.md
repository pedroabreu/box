# publish-it

Attempt to simplify publishing of a js library with different types of source files. By default it will copy the source files and package.json into the published package root.

Default usage is to copy source files and package.json to the published package folder

## Usage

```js
npm install publish-it --save-dev
```

```js
const publishLib = require("../src")

publishLib({
    libFolder: "dist",
    srcFolder: "src",
    extraFilesCopy: ["README.md"],
    ignoreFiles: "*.spec.js",
    publishOnFinish: false,
    modules: {
        es: true,
        umd: "npm run something",
        cjs: "npm run anything"
    }
})
```

Add a script to your package.json file

```json
"scripts": {
    ...,
    "publish-it": "node ./path/to/publish.js"
}
```
