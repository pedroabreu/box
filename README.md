# publish-it

Attempt to simplify publishing of a js library with different modules and keep it lean. By default it will copy the source files and package.json into the published package root.

For es and umd modules, it creates a folder for each and allows execution of npm scripts to parse and copy source files

## Usage

```js
const publishLib = require("../src")

publishLib({
    libFolder: "dist",
    srcFolder: "src",
    copyFormats: ["js"],
    extraFilesCopy: ["README.md"],
    ignoreFiles: "*.spec.js",
    publishOnFinish: false,
    modules: {
        es: true,
        umd: "npm run something",
        cjs: "npm run anything"
    }
})
```
